# Overview

Trace-X is an application in which quality issues can be processed. For the processing of these quality issues, both for the correct addressing of the quality notification and for a more in-depth search, a large number of semantic models must be accessed depending on the application. The information gained should not be regulated for Quality Expert working with Trace-X Busines App. All semantic models linked to a digital twin should be available for processing.

# Summary
Trace-X can currently display a defined number of semantic models of the BOMLifecyles asPlanned and asBuilt.
In the future, it can be assumed that further as yet unspecified semantic models will be developed which will also be represented in Trace-X.
Trace-X will be developed to generically handle different existing and planned semantic models.

# Problem Statement
- Trace-X can currently display a fixed number of semantic models.
- This involves the well-known semantic models of BOMLifecyle asPlanned and asBuilt (SerialPart, SingleLevelUsage*, SingleLevelBOM, PartAsPlanned, PartSiteInformationAsPlanned, JustInSequence)
- In addition, there is a further set of semantic models which are not currently part of the Trace-X domain model and therefore cannot be displayed at present.
- To avoid having to map every available semantic model in the domain model, there is a requirement to display other semantic models in a more generic form.

# Requirements
- [ ] All semantic models connected to a digital twin can be viewed by a Trace-X user
- [ ] Display of digital twin connected semantic models raw payload in Trace-X FE
- [ ] Display of digital twin connected semantic models payload as graph view in Trace-X FE
- [ ] Display of digital twin connected semantic models payload as tree view in Trace-X FE
- [ ] Semantic Model is displayed with version of semantic model
- [ ] Line numbering for raw and tree viewer
- [ ] API endpoints response bodies are extended with required attributes version and payload for Semantic Model Detail View Panel

# NFR
- [ ] Panel with consistent UUX according to C-X Style Guide

# Out of scope
- Switching between viewer instances in full-screen-mode
- Enabling and disabling of code highlighting (code highlighting is the default)

# Assumptions
There are further aspect models as the ones currently known (SerialPart, Batch, JiS, PartAsPlanned, PartSiteInformation) in the two BomLifecycle asPlanned and asBuilt which are currently implemented and will be relevant in the future.

# Concept

## BE API Extensions
- API GET /assets/as-planned/{assetId}
    - add version attribute to detailAspectModels
    - add payload (link) of semantic models to detailAspectModels
    - add identification attribute to detailAspectModels
- API GET /assets/as-planned/*/children/{childId}
    - add version attribute to detailAspectModels
    - add payload (link) of semantic models to detailAspectModels
    - add identification attribute to detailAspectModels
- API GET /assets/as-built/{assetId}
    - add version attribute to detailAspectModels
    - add identification attribute to detailAspectModels
    - add payload (link) of semantic models to detailAspectModels
- API GET /assets/as-built/*/children/{childId}
    - add version attribute to detailAspectModels
    - add identification attribute to detailAspectModels
    - add payload (link) of semantic models to detailAspectModels

### Changes in DetailView Overlay

- [ ] Detail View must  be scrollable with vertical scrollbar
- [ ] New Panel "Semantic Models" is added to Detail View (de: Semantische Modelle)
- [ ] Panel "Semantic Models" contains table
- [ ] Table contains all "Semantic Models" for selected asset
- [ ] Table contains columns "Semantic Model Name" (de: refer to current translation)
- [ ] Table contains columns "Version" of semantic model (de: Version)
- [ ] Table contains columns "Semantic Model Id" of semantic model (de: ID Semantisches Modell) /== "Identification" of submodel in IRS response /
- [ ] Table columns are sortable (Name alphanumeric, Version uses numeric, natural sorting!)
- [ ] Table columns are NOT filterable
- [ ] Table with vertical scrollbar (No pagination)
- [ ] Viewer Panel has fixed size
- [ ] User selection of Viewer Instance is stored in User Settings. Last selected Viewer Instance will be used for next semantic model selection.
- [ ] User selected semantic model in table is highlighted in dark grey color

## Viewer in full-screen mode
![Viewer Full Screen](Viewer_Full_screen_mode.svg)
- Any viewer instance could be extended to full-screen mode
- Full-screen mode is disabled via X button on the right upper side.
- After closing, full-screen former detail view is shown

## Error View
- Viewer shows error icon
- Viewer show initial message Semantic model cannot be displayed.
- Standard error message: Semantic model cannot be displayed. With detailed user readable message
