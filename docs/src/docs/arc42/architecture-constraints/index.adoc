|Name |Description

|Interoperability
|Trace-X must use the EDC together with Catena-X approved data models to guarantee interoperability between participants.

|Data sovereignty
|Data owners and data consumers have to use usage policies for offering, consuming and therefore transferring data.

|Kubernetes for container orchestration
|Catena-X requires the application to run in a Kubernetes environment, deployed via Helm charts.

|Catena-X UUX guidance (CX style guide)
|The frontend of Trace-X follows Catena-X-wide UUX consistency according to the CX style guide.

|Name |Description

|Schedule
|Start of development in July 2022. Further development in alignment with the foundation of the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. requirements and timeline.

|Process model
|Iterative and incremental. The SAFe framework is used to align with Catena-X services, prerequisites, components and requirements to be Catena-X compatible.

|Catena-X services / requirements
|Trace-X needs to be Catena-X compliant and the application has to follow the CX standards as well as interact with the core services and components.

|Release as open source
|The source code - at least partially - is made available as open source and can be found in GitHub Catena-X ng as well as in Eclipse Tractus-X.

|Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for products developed within the CX consortia
|As Trace-X is a reference implementation, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) must not be above TRL 8.
