= Scenario 1: Receive import report

This section describes what happens when the user wants to get a report of the imported assets associated with a importJobId.
In this example, the user requests an import report.

....

== Overview

When a user requests an import report, Trace-X checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR').
If yes, the endpoint returns the import report of the given importJobId.

If the importJobId is not known to Trace-X, an HTTP 404 error is returned.
