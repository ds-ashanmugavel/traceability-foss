== Overview
The EDC is utilized to transmit data between sender and receiver for both sending and receiving notifications.
To be able to send notifications to a partner you need to

* Create a notification endpoint for qualitynotifications/send
* Create EDC assets
* Create EDC usage policies
* Create EDC contract definitions

Trace-X implements a functionality to create assets and their corresponding policies in the admin panel.

With the notification asset it is possible to enable EDC contract negotiation and EDC data transfer process so that the quality investigation can be sent by the sender.
