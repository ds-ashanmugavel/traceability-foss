= Scenario 1: Return assets

This section describes what happens when users list stored assets.
In this example, the user requests as-built assets.
The same can be done with as-planned assets.

== Overview

When a user requests stored assets, Trace-X checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR', 'ROLE_USER').
If yes, then the endpoint returns a pageable result of assets.

The returned result can be empty if no suitable asset has been found.
