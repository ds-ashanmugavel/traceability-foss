== Overview

In case a user requests contract agreements, Trace-X checks if the user has required roles ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR').
If yes, then the requested assets will be mapped to the related contract agreement id.
These contract agreement ids will be then requested on EDC side via POST (/management/v2/contractagreements/request) and GET (/management/v2/contractagreements/\{ContractAgreementId\}/negotiation) to get the relevant information.

The contract information is then returned by the endpoint as a pageable result.

If no asset ids are provided in the request, 50 contract agreement ids are handled by default.
