== Overview

Data is fetched by a Trace-X instance using the Digital Twin Registry (DTR), Item Relationship Service (IRS) and Trace-X consumer EDC.
For digital twins the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standard is used. For fetching data with Trace-X a Digital Twin Registry and an IRS instance are required. Data should represent parts, supplier and customer parts, part trees / part relations.
