== Module / package structure

* Main domain name

** Application
*** Optional: subdomain name (in case of inheritance) â†’ following same structure as main domain
*** Mapper: holds the mapper of transforming domain models to response models
*** Service: holds the interface for implementation in the domain package
*** REST: holds the controller for providing the API for the domain
** Domain
*** Optional: subdomain name (in case of inheritance)
*** Model: holds the domain model
*** Service: implementation of the interface provided in the application package
*** Repository: holds the interface for accessing the infrastructure package
** Infrastructure
*** Optional: subdomain name (in case of inheritance)
*** Model: holds the technical entities
*** Repository: holds the data access layer
**** E.g. JPARepository / Impl
** All models (request / response) used in the API should be saved in the tx-model project to be reusable for cucumber testing.
